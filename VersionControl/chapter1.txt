This is my first time using Git. 

Git status 
Shows files inside your staging area 
Stagin area 
An intermediate place where you can pick and choose which files inside your working directory you want to commit

Files in red are the files inside the working directory, those files are not yet inside the staging area, you cannot track changes in them yet 

Git add filename, to add to the staging area
